    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

    <p class="statement">I have been fortunate enough to travel throughout the world and have always enjoyed the challenge of learning a new language and culture. This is why I have become so passionate about the development field. The learning of a new language and the ability
      to create something through that language that will benefit society keeps me thirsting for more.</p>
    <p class="statement">In my career I have worked in various positions; from a Skydiving Instructor to the VP of Operations for a national cable company. It's this large knowledge base and real world experience that I am able to bring to the team; as well as the drive for
      communication in collaboration.
